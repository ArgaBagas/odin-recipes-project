            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Jjajangmyeon is everybody’s favorite food. It’s actually a very popular Korean Chinese dish, created by early Chinese immigrants in Korea, catering to Korean tastes. Tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork) is another example. The almost caramel taste of the savory black bean sauce over the thick, chewy wheat flour noodles makes for a really unique taste and texture.</p>
            <p>Koreans even have a nonofficial celebration for jjm on April 14th, when single people celebrate their shared loneliness on Black Day with a bowl of jjajangmyeon.</p>
            <p>While there are many theories about when it was first introduced to Korea, officially the first known Jajangmyeon is from a restaurant called Gonghwachun (공화춘) in Chinatown of Incheon, Korea back in 1905. It was introduced by Chinese merchants but the flavor evolved to suit Korean’s taste buds over time.</p>

            <h3>Steps how to make it</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir-fry the pork belly in a large, deep wok (or pan) with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil for about 4-5 minutes, until golden brown and crispy.</li>
                <li>Pour out the excess pork fat.</li>
                <li>Add radish and stir fry for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add potato, onion, and zucchini and keep stirring for about 3 minutes until the potato looks a little translucent.</li>
                <li>Clear a space in the center of the wok by pushing the ingredients to the edges.</li>
                <li>Add 2 Tablespoons of vegetable oil to the center of the wok, then add ¼ cup of black bean paste and stir it with a wooden spoon for 1 minute to fry it. Then mix everything in the wok and keep stirring.</li>
                <li>Add  2 cups of water to the wok and let it simmer and cook with the lid closed for about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Open the lid and taste a sample of the radish and potato. If they're fully cooked, stir in the starch water little by little. Keep stirring until it's well mixed and thick.</li>
                <li>Add the sesame oil and remove from the heat.</li>
                <li>Serve with noodles (jjajangmyeon) or steamed rice (jjajangbap).</li>
